Title: **Studdy Buddy**: A Virtual Companion for NSUers

Project Overview:

We propose to develop an innovative educational companion app named Studdy Buddy, designed to assist students and provide a one-step solution for better managing their academic lives. It includes a dynamic homepage and profile section where users can save and access academic information. It has a course manager to manage enrolled courses, query a particular course information, routine settings to customise class schedules, and an assignment scheduler to track and manage deadlines. There's also a course advisor feature for course recommendations and a CGPA insight option for understanding cumulative grade point averages, as well as a menu for easy navigation across all features. Some additional features might be added.
